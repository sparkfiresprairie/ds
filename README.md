This is an introductory graduate level course in distributed systems. It exposes us to theoretical as well as practical aspects of designing distributed systems. 

## Project1. Reservation System ##

The goal of this project is to learn the knowledge about the fault-tolerance of servers that is based upon active replications. Specifically, we implemented a ticket reservation system with fault-tolerance for a movie theatre.
